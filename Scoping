The key motivators for this project are to enhance talent retention, reduce costs associated with turnover, and improve decision-making through data-driven insights. The project aims to enhance the employee experience, enable strategic workforce planning, and align HR strategies with quantitatively informed models. Collaboration with the quant team brings advanced risk assessment techniques to the HR domain. Ultimately, the project aims to provide a competitive advantage by fostering a stable and motivated workforce, contributing to long-term organizational success.

The target population for development comprises active employees within the organization. This includes individuals across various roles, departments, and levels, who are part of the workforce. The project aims to predict the likelihood of these employees leaving the organization within a specific timeframe.

The development encompasses both tactical and strategic aspects. Tactically, it involves building a predictive model to assess the likelihood of employee attrition within a defined period. This aids in making immediate decisions to retain valuable employees. Strategically, the project contributes to long-term organizational success by fostering a stable workforce, enhancing employee engagement, and enabling informed workforce planning. By combining tactical prediction with strategic insights, the project addresses both immediate retention concerns and aligns with the organization's broader HR strategies.

The project's planned launch date is set to [Specify Planned Launch Date]. This timeline aligns with [Explain Why This Date Was Chosen - E.g., end of fiscal year, upcoming strategic initiatives]. It allows sufficient time for data collection, model development, validation, and necessary adjustments. However, flexibility exists to adapt the launch based on the project's progress and potential refinements. This ensures that the solution is thoroughly tested and aligned with the organization's goals before deployment.

The overarching strategy complements the predictive model with a comprehensive approach to employee retention. This includes proactive interventions for high-risk employees, personalized retention initiatives, skill and leadership development programs, and transparent communication channels. Succession planning and job redesign ensure smooth transitions and alignment with employee aspirations. Flexible work arrangements and recognition initiatives promote work-life balance and job satisfaction. By integrating data-driven predictions with targeted strategies, the organization aims to create a conducive environment that retains valuable talent and aligns with long-term goals.

Potential data sources encompass HR records (demographics, job history), performance data, engagement surveys, exit interviews, time/attendance, training records, workload metrics, internal mobility, manager feedback, market data, health programs, communication data, company events, social media activity. These sources, scattered across various locations such as HRIS, performance tools, and surveys, provide a comprehensive view of employee interactions, experiences, and sentiments. Integrating data from these sources forms the foundation for the attrition prediction model, enhancing its accuracy and predictive powe

Data limitations include missing/inaccurate data, small sample size, imbalanced classes, changing trends, external influences, limited features, privacy concerns, assumptions, overfitting, and model complexity. Addressing these constraints requires preprocessing, validation, and ongoing refinement to ensure reliable predictions.

The model will be implemented within the organization's existing data infrastructure, utilizing suitable software frameworks for data processing, model development, and deployment. Integration might involve cloud-based platforms, analytics tools, and relevant programming languages, ensuring seamless incorporation into daily HR operations.

Select sample windows considering time relevance, training data sufficiency, prediction horizon alignment, seasonal patterns, data granularity, outlier handling, window stability, data availability, and validation. This balance enhances model accuracy and effectiveness.

Expectations for performance point exposure encompass minimizing false positives and negatives. Strive to maintain a balanced model that accurately identifies potential leavers while avoiding unnecessary alerts for non-leavers. Focus on optimizing precision and recall metrics to strike the right balance between correctly identifying those likely to leave and avoiding unnecessary intervention for those likely to stay.

For target definition, the expectation is to define a "likelihood to leave" threshold that balances between true positives and false positives. This threshold determines how high the probability should be for an individual to be classified as a potential leaver. Finding the optimal threshold is crucial as it affects the trade-off between correctly identifying potential leavers and minimizing false alarms. This requires analyzing the ROC curve, precision-recall curve, and considering the organization's tolerance for false positives and false negatives.

Consider these segments for targeted retention strategies: high performers, critical roles, early-career employees, high attrition departments, potential leaders, remote workers, underrepresented groups, skill gaps, and mid-career employees. Tailoring interventions to these segments enhances retention efforts.

Observation Point Exclusions:

Example: Exclude data from the year a major company merger occurred to prevent its impact on attrition rates during that period.
Example: Exclude data from a specific quarter when the organization underwent significant restructuring, which could lead to abnormal attrition patterns.
Performance Point Exclusions:

Example: Exclude employees with extremely high performance ratings (outliers) to prevent their skewing effect on the model's predictions.
Example: Exclude employees with exceptionally low performance scores if they represent a unique case that doesn't reflect the general attrition pattern.
Both types of exclusions aim to refine the dataset to ensure that the analysis captures the most representative and meaningful insights for effective attrition prediction.

Potential risks: model bias, privacy concerns, limited historical data, changing external factors, false positives, model complexity, data quality issues, stakeholder acceptance, intervention costs, model maintenance. Mitigation strategies are essential for project success.
